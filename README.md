# ProjectEuler
This is a repository for solving various Project Euler problems.

# Programming Test

The 2 problems are:

https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

You should include with your solution:

# A sample of the output

"Problem 1: sum of multiples of 3 or 5, up 1K = 266333"

"Problem 2: sum of even Fibonacci numbers, up to 4M = 4613732"

# Why you chose the problems you did

  problem 1.) I liked that fact that both an iterative solution and a math based summation formula could work.
  problem 2.) I liked the fact that I could use some caching optimization to solve it rather than recursively or inefficiently.

# A description of the process you followed in solving the problem

1. Start with determining the goal for each solution:

   a.) Reasoned out the method for summing up the multiples problem 1. 

   b.) Determine the best approach for summing the Fibonacci sequencing for problem 2.

2. Understand what the solution required:
  
   problem 1.) "Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000"
  
   problem 2.) "Find the sum of the even-valued terms" 

3. Determined inputs and outputs / variables

4. Coded and debugged

5. Assure the solutions are correct and accurate by comparing against a math based calculation of the answers.

6. Commit the code

# What reference sources you used, if any

# How much time you spent on the exercise

 Approximately 3 hours
